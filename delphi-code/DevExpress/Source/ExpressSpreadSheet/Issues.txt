Known differences between ESS and Excel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are features that exist in the Excel User Interface that are not currently supported by ExpressSpreadSheet, many of these can be implemented programmatically by the developer as needed.  For example: issue 3941- ExpressSpreadSheet does not support all Excel functions.  However users can programmatically add any custom function (see the CustomFunction demo for an example).  

Note many of these features are under active development for a later release of this product and will be prioritized based upon user demand.
