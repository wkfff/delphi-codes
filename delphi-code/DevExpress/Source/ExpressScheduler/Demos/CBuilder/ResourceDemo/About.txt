This demo shows how the ExpressScheduler can be used in applications that deal with resource allocation. In this example it is used by a small rental company which has 4 exotic sport cars.

In this demo you can:

 - Show/hide resources (in this example they are the cars) and the associated events that are displayed for them depend upon what is selected in the list view (located on the main form's left side)

 - Change how events are grouped and the layout of resources using the "Resources" item in the Main menu

 - See how different views display resources and events by using the "Day"/"Work week"/"Week"/"Month//Timegrid/Yea" items in the "View" item of the Main menu or by selecting different periods of time in the Date Navigator

 - Rent a car or cancel a reservation using the Main menu, the popupmenu or the toolbar (you can see the Date Navigator function in standalone mode and also how to work with events in code). All the other ways of modifying the contents of the scheduler are disabled

 - See recurring events used for "Car wash" and "Maintenance"

 - Use custom menuitems in the scheduler's built-in popupmenu ("Rent a car" and "Cancel reservation")

 - See how custom drawing can be used to change the default colors of the day, week and weeks views and the appearance of the Date Navigator (you can turn this on and off by using the "View|Use alternative colors" menu item)

 - See how the TStringGrid (or any other similar control) can be placed on the scheduler and filled with data from events

 - Synchronize the selection in the TStringGrid with the selected events in the scheduler by selecting an event or row
